# Youtube Play With MPV Native Client

This is the native client (i.e. binary) for the [Youtube Play With MPV Chrome Extension](https://github.com/Darkle/youtube-play-with-mpv-chrome-extension#readme "Youtube Play With MPV Chrome Extension repo page"). You need to install this in order for the Chrome extension to be able to open a Youtube video in [mpv](https://mpv.io/ "mpv homepage").

### Important
If you install the Native Client after you install the Chrome extension, make sure to disable, then re-enable the Chrome extension.

### Prerequisites

Windows 64bit

### Installer

Download the installer here: https://github.com/Darkle/youtube-play-with-mpv-native-client/releases

The installer includes the [mpv](https://mpv.io/ "mpv homepage") and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ "youtube-dl homepage") binaries so you don't have to install them yourself.

Note: if you would like to update either the mpv binary or the youtube-dl binary after installation, you can manually replace the files. They are located in `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\ytplaywithmpv`.
